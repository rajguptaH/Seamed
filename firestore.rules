/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for SeaMed Inventory application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a role-based access control model, supplemented by user-ownership for individual user documents.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores individual user profiles, secured via ownership. Includes a denormalized vesselId.
 * - /vessels/{vesselId}: Stores vessel data, with open read access and owner-only writes.
 * - /roles_admin/{userId}: Indicates admin role through document presence.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Admin privileges are granted based on the existence of a document in the `/roles_admin/{userId}` collection.
 * - User listing is generally disallowed except for admins.
 * - Users can only create their own user document at /users/{userId}.
 * - Vessels can be read publicly, but only admins can create, update, or delete them.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `vesselId` is denormalized into the `/users/{userId}` document. This avoids costly `get()` operations when checking user permissions related to vessels.
